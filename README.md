## Introduction

This script is designed for GTA 5 FiveM servers to simulate human vision by making NPCs within the player's field of view semi-transparent. This feature helps players in roleplay scenarios by visually indicating which NPCs and players they haven't seen, enhancing immersion and realism.

## Features

- **Field of View Simulation**: NPCs and Players within the character's field of view are rendered semi-transparent, indicating they haven't been seen by the player.
- **Immersive Roleplay**: Enhances roleplay by providing visual cues about what the character can or cannot see.
- **Efficient Performance**: The script is optimized with a low resmon value of 0.01, ensuring minimal impact on server performance.
